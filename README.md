# Disease-Predictor
This project predicts diseases based on user symptoms using a machine learning model. The model is trained on symptom-disease relationships and uses a multi-class classification approach to identify the most probable illness. It helps in early disease detection, assisting users and healthcare professionals in preliminary diagnosis.
